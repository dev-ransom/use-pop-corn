## 1. Splitting UI into Components

Learn the art of breaking down complex user interfaces into manageable and reusable components. This section emphasizes the importance of modular design and clean separation of concerns.

## 2. Component Categories

Understand different types of components and their roles in a React application. Explore concepts like presentational components, container components, and how they contribute to a scalable architecture.

## 3. Prop Drilling

Dive into the challenges of prop drilling and discover strategies to pass data through components efficiently. Learn when prop drilling is acceptable and explore alternatives when it becomes cumbersome.

## 4. Component Composition

Explore the power of component composition, combining smaller components to create more complex and feature-rich UI elements. Understand how this approach promotes code reuse and maintainability.

## 5. Fixing Prop Drilling with Composition

Discover how component composition can be leveraged to eliminate prop drilling issues. Learn practical examples of restructuring components to enhance data flow and maintain a clean codebase.

## 6. Using Composition to Make Reusable Box

Create a reusable box component using the principles of composition. This section demonstrates how to build flexible and versatile UI elements that can be easily integrated into different parts of your application.

## 7. Passing Elements as Props

Explore the concept of passing React elements as props. Learn how this technique enhances component flexibility and enables the dynamic rendering of different elements within a parent component.

## 8. Handling Hover Event

Understand how to handle hover events in React components. Learn techniques to add interactivity to your UI by responding to user actions like hovering over specific elements.

## 9. Props as Component API

View props as the API of your components. Learn to design components with a well-defined and flexible API, enabling users to interact with and customize components seamlessly.

## 10. Improving Reusability with Props

Explore advanced techniques to improve component reusability through prop variations. Learn how to design components that adapt to different use cases by configuring their behavior through props.

## 11. Prototypes

Dive into the prototyping phase, where you transform your design concepts into functional React components. Learn best practices for creating robust prototypes that serve as the foundation for your application development.
